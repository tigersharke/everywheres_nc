             NodeCore - Minetest's top original voxel game
                about emergent mechanics and exploration
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A surreal dream-world where everything is possible but nothing is easy.
Peaceful and Zen.  Brutally obstinate.  Prepare to unlearn everything
you thought you knew about voxel sandbox games.

This texture pack is presently a simple copy of that which is provided
by the Alpha Nodecore Game as installed via minetest client.  Intent is
to eventually make a complete nodecorian minetest texture, but until
then this texture pack can serve as a handy local override as needed.

* There are two options for a three-tine rake texture, a triangular, 
  and a pitchforky style. Both included, rename or copy the desired 
  texture as below.

  nc_lode_rake-pfk.png OR nc_lode_rake-tri.png
  Becomes: nc_lode_rake.png

  nc_woodwork_rake-pfk.png OR nc_woodwork_rake-tri.png
  Becomes: nc_woodwork_rake.png
